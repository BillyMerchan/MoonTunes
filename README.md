 ## :octocat: Heya, welcome to Moon Tunes!
Moon Tunes was a submission for HACKRPI22, the annual Hackathon hosted by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

We had about a day to hack together something with a *space* theme, inspired by a website I used to mess around with, we decided to make our own sound visualizer of sorts, where you can create unique beats with fun visuals in space!

All of the audio files were vocal chops taken from drum n' base and edm songs that we re-pitched.

The visuals were all done in Adobe Illustrator.

Since we only really needed a front-end application, we decided to go with react for our framework, using the React Router DOM to ensure a seamless transition between our pages and add to the modularity of the project.

## Moon Tunes How-To!
Moon Tunes is a pretty simple concept but that's what makes it great! As of right now, the first two rows of your keyboard are each synced to a different sound. They are also group into a few categories to make it easier to construct tiny little melodies. As you press on your keyboard, planets and stars will shoot across the screen and give you your very own cosmic show!

Below are some pictures of the legend that will help you navigate your newly-transformed keyboard, and some other picture of Moon Tunes in action!
